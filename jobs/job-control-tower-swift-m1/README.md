# Job: Control Tower Swift Companion – Milestone 1

## Objective

- Deliver Milestone 1 of the Control Tower Swift Companion: read-only dashboard that watches lifecycle-radar + control-panel artefacts, renders readiness charts, and exposes manual refresh buttons for radar/preflight/panel scripts.
- Align with the architecture document in `n00-dashboard/docs/control-tower-app.md` and ensure the macOS target builds via Swift Package Manager (`swift build`).
- Definition of done: SwiftUI app displays live radar metrics + outstanding jobs, includes Quick Links to runbooks, and ships with documentation on how to install/run it locally.

## Inputs & Dependencies

- Lifecycle radar JSON + control panel Markdown generated by the other jobs.
- Swift architecture doc plus existing `n00-dashboard` workspace + packages.
- n00-frontiers UI/UX guidelines for color/typography and n00t capability manifest (future automation runner).

## Quality Gates

1. `swift build --configuration release` succeeds (and eventually `swift test` when we add coverage).
2. UX review from product-office ensures accessibility + frontier visual language.
3. Documentation added to `n00-dashboard/README.md` describing setup + usage.
4. `project.preflight` returns `ok` once integration IDs exist + QA evidence logged in Notes.

## Traceability & Telemetry

- Artefacts/logs captured via `.dev/automation/artifacts/project-sync/job-control-tower-swift-m1.json` plus build/test logs stored under `n00-dashboard/artifacts/`.
- Fill in GitHub/ERPNext identifiers once the board/project is provisioned.

## Notes & Updates

- 2025-11-09: Scope recorded; awaiting assignment + UI spike.
